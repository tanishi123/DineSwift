      "Meet Kothari": "I don't know about premium pizza of dominos but the pizza mania is of very low quality. Its like they are providing food to us as charity or free of cost. And the bread they use is like you chewing some garbage that can cause stomach ache as i experienced on the next when i had dominos pizza on the previous day. Seriously dominos should be banned in india for providing such a cheap quality. Its totally unacceptable. Very bad experience. Sorry to say but its actually true. And its not about particular area restaurant. Everywhere its the same garbage we are eating",
      "Devesh Vyas": "I used to be a big fan of their cheese burst pizza.. but i was so disappointed this time because it was nothing like a cheese burst.. there was hardly any extra cheese in that thing.. amd the second pizza is golden corn which you can clearly see that has no corn at all. The only thing good about this meal was the butterscotch mousse cake. Really really disappointed!",

Also in sweets they had only moong dal halwa but usually Gujrati thalis have 2-3 varieties of sweets but I think overall it is good for 280 bucks per person (all inclusive).

I hosted a party and this outlet was the one that provided me VEG & JAIN pizzas under one roof such a relief!Not to mention that the party was a big success !The food delivery system is quite efficient!I ordered via call Center but the outlet called be back and suggested me a cheaper and better tasting pizzas also got me discounts so 5 brownie points !The phone operator was super friendly! The guy on pickup desk was also super polite and the waiting area is too good !Been here a couple of time before 2012 but this space has changed and the ambiance is so chilled! Staff is chilled and it\u2019s a perfect party space !!! Cheers to the wornderfull staff !!Overall...read more",

      "Guru Mitul Shah": "I love the pizza Hut since my Teenage days, when they used to have \"Extra Excited Customer Delight\" TV commercials. Anyday i would select Pizza Hut over any other Pizza Joint.\u00a0It was a casual reunion of We Ex Emplooyees and we were in search of a place which is convenient to reach for all. And we decided to go to PH, GD. We ordered a few Pizzas, mocktails and garlic breads. Quick service and Piping Hot pizza are the 2 things that made our day.\u00a0I wish them all the best and i will always be the fan of Pizza Hut.Cheers:Also check my Food Journey on my Facebook and Instagram profile by the name \"gurumitulshah\"",
      "Ravi Rajput": "It was my worst experience ever..No proper service at all..I was waiting there for more then 30 mins but none of the waiter was there for serve..nd one more thing the price was also quite higher..I dont think so this is one of the place for hangouts.I was really disappointed..i dont ever think to visit this place again..afterall totally waste of money as well as time..",
      "Saurabh Saxena": "Simply not worth going. They have become a brand but I didn't expect the food quality like this...I tried the unlimited pizza few days back. It was actually waste of money.The quantity of cheese was perfect on the bread, but it's like you are eating just a bread and cheese..Taste was missing,Smell was missing,(You get that smell in Domino's, when your pizza arrives at your table).Service was average.(I think the staff and cook is not well prepared for unlimited... It's once in a week activity for them. And it becomes difficult for them to serve that fast. )Lost those photographs... But look wise pizza will look tasty , but in real it is now,May be in unlimited menu only they...read more",

      "Raajessh Sharma": "great pizzas, soft cheessy as they should be, service is a little slow, and they don't have any branches except this place, that's not fair for pizza lovers",
      "Mayank Maheshwari": "Well I really love Pizza hut but I am really dis-satisfied with this outlet's service.I was sitting their for more then 20 minutes but none of the waiter was available to serve. Even after this much of waiting and asking for waiters several times no one was available to even serve water.Even the manager was not available when I asked for him.This same service was given to 3rd time in a row.So the food is good but you better have a lot of spare time, not thirsty and not very hungry if you want to visit this place. ",
      "Prateek Singh": "take away is amazing. its no time waiting and you can take your pizza along with you. enjoy your delicious cheese brunch and stretch the joy of bread.",
      "MANVENDRASINH VANSIA": "Excellent food. It really has a great variety of food and really good taste too. But it has the worst service I have ever experienced. I asked for a glass of water and it took the guy around 20-25 mins to bring a glass. Really expected much more. ",
      "Nil Desai": "The service was poor. Didn\u2019t match my expectation. The customer service was poor. Even the manager was not so keen to service us. Hope they will do something to enhance this. I ask to employer where is manager they didn\u2019t reply me such fuck this place many time ",
      "Hardik Modha": "A good experience with the taste of pizzas. I had to wait first for table and then for food. Though it was Sunday but the service should be bit fast......Worth the wait.....",
      "Jatin Krishu": "Pizza at pizza hut is the best idea for pizza lovers. But the service is a little lazy kind. Green apple mojito with any cheeze burst pizza would be a great deal. Some where/sometimes/ rarely seen some burnt spots on the topping but it is ignorable.",
      "Rahul Yadav": "place is good ambiance is great. other than the wide menu with great stuff the location also is playing a important role. number of Staff should be increased, else all the stuff is enjoyable. The mocktail menu is worth trying"

But they\u2019re samosas you\u2019ll get in the south, not the Punjabi garam masala samosas. The filling was white, on the sweeter side with a hint of coconut and green chillies. Still quite tasty.

      "Viraj Desai": "I've been visiting this place since ages and it has always been amazing. Its a busy outlet and its difficult to get a table here due to rush but once you get in, be ready for a lip-smacking treat. The ambience of the restaurant has improved alot post renovation and the staff is really very friendly.This place serves some amazing south-Indian dishes, among which I would strongly recommend Dahi Wada, Samosa Onion Uttapam, Lemon, Coffee, and Green Chutney Dosa! They are must-haves!",
      "Nakshatra Patel": "The oldest restaurant of Surat maybe! My parents used to go their on a date (that old). But my parents still totally love the place because of the taste and quality that it provides! You will have to wait to get a table as the place is not that huge. If you love South Indian food than this is the place for you. I personally don't like this place because of the behaviour of the staff. They are so rude and arrogant, at times you feel as if they are obliging you by taking your order. Food is great! ",
      "Shreya Thakur": "This is the best place for a good and budget South Indian mean. I love their idli and vada sambhar as well as the rava masala dosa.

People will always be found waiting outside in burning sun, as there is no waiting area before dine-in, looks many times like a Ration Shop queue",

The place was full but the service was very prompt. Their turn around time was less than 20 minutes per table. This is not your leisurely lunch place, it is crowded, noisy with quite tight seating arrangements.We ordered Fresh Lime, Mysore Masala Dosa, Masala Dosa, Danhi Bundi and Vada Sambhar. I loved Fresh Lime with a hint of cardamom in it, very refreshing. Perfect for scorching summers! Danhi Bundi was a little bit...read more",

This 52 year old restaurant lived up to its reputation :)Ordered a plate of samosa, 2 Mysore Masala dosa , a plain dosa and a lemon juice :) The term value for money goes synonymous with place as the total bill was just Rs.220/-After a long time had a coconut chutney which was made of coconut and not mixed with Roasted gram :) I was so Happy :)Every thing was good be it the fast service , token system for Que or the people who serve you :)Must visit this place if you crave for \"Authentic\" south indian food :)",

I had gone with my friend and it was lunchtime so the place was packed. We sat on a table , the two of us, and then ordered the food. Then a customer entered and to our surprise the waiter guided him to our table and he sat down. I was so flabbergasted, I couldn't speak for a minute. Then when we told the manager, he arranged another table for him and the problem was solved almost immediately. This incident was the only downside for an otherwise very good place.",

They are best in bussiness from very long time. Extra chutney sambhar will be charged extra to you. They are serving well with the limitations they have like lack of space, lack of ambiance etc. You have to stop in the waiting for many occasions. Good food good taste.  ",

Just wow.So after reading the rave reviews, I was expecting the place to serve me mind blowing south indian food. But alas! The place serves good food no doubt, but it isnt something that would make me crave for more of it. I tried their idli wada sambhar and their mysore masala dosa. The sambhar was a little on the sweeter side. The best part about the place is that is actually a Value for Money. The total damage for the 2 dishes was just Rs 100. ",

Been around for years, and in spite of every other customer advising the management (Shettybhai) to expand, the place remains a small one with a palm-sized sit-out. The taste of the food, on one hand cannot be tagged \"authentic south-indian\", but having said that, it is the \"migrant south-indian\" taste and to the Gujarati palette, it works wonders. The samosas in the brown paper bag have been a stand-out and if one is patient, the other fare like dosa, etc must be tried while seated in the tiny cafe. True to its name, it really is a tiny, pleasant Mysuru Cafe. ",
